### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? Here's some ideas for things to continue with:

1. Add more information about the product on hover, use the `description` parameter for this. [Here's an example](https://www.apoteket.se/kategori/erbjudanden/) of what we're thinking.
1. Make your page responsive and work for mobile and tablets. Use a 2-column layout on tablet and single column for mobile.
1. Add a header to the listing that tells how many products you are showing. `xxx products`.
